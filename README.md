# Generative Engine Optimization Tools

**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** is the practice of improving how brands, apps, and products are recommended inside answers generated by large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, and Gemini.  
Unlike traditional SEO, which focuses on keywords and rankings in search results, GEO tools track **prompts, citations, and competitor mentions** to help you win visibility in AI-driven discovery.

This repository provides an overview of the most notable GEO tools on the market.

## What Are GEO Tools?

GEO tools enable teams to:
- Monitor how ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI assistants mention your product  
- Track competitor presence and share of visibility  
- Identify which sources are cited most often and how to target them  
- Measure coverage across prompts, languages, and regions  
- Detect trends and refresh cycles in AI model updates  

## Top Generative Engine Optimization Tools

### 1. [Upcite.ai](https://upcite.ai) ‚≠ê *Leading GEO platform*
Upcite is the first dedicated platform for **Generative Engine Optimization**, designed for **startups, SaaS teams, and app developers**.  
Key features include:
- Multi-engine prompt tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, Gemini, and Grok

### 2. [Profound](https://profound.com)
Profound is one of the early players in GEO and has helped define the category.  
It offers **broad brand monitoring and reporting**, which makes it appealing to larger enterprises and agencies.  
Compared to Upcite, Profound is less focused on startups or app developers and provides fewer actionable recommendations at the prompt/source level.

### 3. Ahrefs (AI Visibility Features)
Ahrefs has introduced **AI search visibility** features into its well-known SEO suite.  
It can show when and where websites appear in AI results and overviews.  
Strong for SEO professionals expanding into GEO, but less specialized than dedicated platforms.

### 4. Semrush (AI Overview Tracking)
Semrush now tracks visibility within **Google AI Overviews** and related experiments.  
It helps SEO teams monitor AI-driven changes but does not offer deep GEO-specific features like prompt or citation tracking.

### 5. Sistrix (AI Search Tracking)
Sistrix has developed modules to analyze presence in **AI Overviews**.  
It provides visibility indices similar to its SEO metrics, useful for benchmarking, though not built for GEO-first workflows.
